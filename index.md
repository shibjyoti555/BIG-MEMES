## The BIG MEMES (⌐■_■) Whatsapp group

## The rules of the group

>No unfunny memes*.

>Definitely - HEY! LISTEN TO ME! - DEFINITELY ***NO UNFUNNY MEMES****.

>NSFW memes **must** be a view once.

>Memes like "Only 90's kids will remember" are **NOT** memes. They are nostalgic shitposts.

>Racist, political, misogynistic and other offensive memes are allowed only if you are joking and not seriously a low-minded creature.

>Try to understand the jokes because obviously everyone is joking

>EACH AND EVERY THING - I repeat - EACH AND EVERY THING sent in this group is a GODDAMN JOKE

>If you find a joke/meme offensive, please try to cope with it; and, in case, it is too offensive to be avoided, you can complain against them in the group. The offender will be banned accordingly after examining the joke/meme

### Anyone violating the above rules will be forgiven the first time, but will be suspended from messaging for a maximum of 6 hours, considering the *illegality* of their deeds
