## The BIG MEMES (⌐■_■) Whatsapp group

## The rules of the group

>No unfunny memes*.

>Definitely - HEY! LISTEN TO ME! - DEFINITELY ***NO UNFUNNY MEMES****.

>NSFW memes **must** me a view once.

>Memes like "Only 90's kids will remember" are **NOT** memes. They are nostalgic shitposts.

>Racist, political, misogynist and other ovvensive memes are allowed until you are joking and not seriously a low-minded creature.

### Anyone violating the above rules will be forgiven the first time, but will be suspended from messaging for a maximum of 6 hours, considering the *illegality* of their deeds

I aggree with the rules and want to [join](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CCBOT11CHKj83ROMdICfBN) "BIG MEMES (⌐■_■)"

<sub>*unfunny memes also include stale memes that are circulating through everyone's statuses and social media pages excessively and everybody has already seen them</sub>
